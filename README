License
=======
Pyreshark is released under the GNU GPLv2 license. See <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html> for details.

Installation
============
Python 2.7.* or 2.6.* is required, so make sure it is installed.

Put pyreshark.dll in <Wireshark-Dir>\plugins\1.*.*\
Put all files in the python folder in <Wireshark-Dir>\python.

The overall directory structure should be:
<Wireshark-Dir>\python
<Wireshark-Dir>\python\cal
<Wireshark-Dir>\python\protocols

Using Pyreshark
===============

To add an existing dissector just drop it in <Wireshark-Dir>\python\protocols

To write a new dissector see the guide at http://code.google.com/p/pyreshark/wiki/WritingDissectors


Building Pyreshark
==================
Currently the plugin was tested on win32, win64 and some linux distro's.

Win32/64 Instructions:

    1. Get Wireshark's source.
    2. Build Wireshark.
    3. Get pyreshark's source through hg clone.
    4. Place pyreshark's source in the plugins dir of Wireshark's source.
    5. (win64 only) Wirehsark's config.h has to be tweaked since it collides with python's headers, I hacked the end to the following, and it is apparently working:
        
        #ifdef _WIN64
        typedef __int64 ssize_t;
        #else
        #if !defined(QT_VERSION) || !defined(_SSIZE_T_DEFINED)
        typedef int ssize_t;
        #endif
        #endif

    6. Go to <WS_source_root>\plugins\pyreshark and run:
        nmake -f Makefile.nmake all
    7. If all went well, you can now copy the shiny new pyreshark.dll and python folder to your Wireshark installation.

Linux Instructions:
    1. Get Wireshark's source.
    3. Get pyreshark's source through hg clone.
    4. Place pyreshark's source in the plugins dir of Wireshark's source.
    5. Follow the instructions in http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/wireshark/trunk/doc/README.plugins
    6. Build Wireshark and install it.
    7. If all went well, you should have the plugin installed as well.
